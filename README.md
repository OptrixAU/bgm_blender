# bgm_blender
A Blender file with models and shaders to create simple preview photos of board games.

# Introduction
This is a Blender file (to use with the Blender renderer) you can use to create preview photos of board-game components and game setups using artwork made according to the templates from www.BoardGameMaker.com

You will still need some knowledge of how Blender works, but at least you won't have to make the models from scratch.

Note that models are scaled in METRIC, even where their names indicate that they are imperial (ie. 0.5Inch, 1Inch etc.).

# Notes

The Cycles renderer is used, which produces very high-quality, realistic results, at the cost of a little bit of material complexity. To modify any of the textures used, you will need to click in the bottom-left corner of the screen and choose 'Node Editor' with the material you want to change selected.
